```Scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
    0
    y))

(test 0 (p))
```

Recall:
* applicative-order evaluation is *call-by-value*. The arguments are evaluated first.
* normal-order evaluation is *call-by-name*. The arguments are substituted in the procedure and then the procedure is evaluated.

If Ben's interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation, it will get stuck in an endless loop trying to evaluate the second argument of the procedure call `(test 0 (p))`. 
If Ben's interpreter uses normal-order evaluation, the procedure call evaluates to its body with the formal arguments replaced by the values provided in the application:
```Scheme
(if (= 0 0)
  0
  (p))
```
which evaluates to `0`.
