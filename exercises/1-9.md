```Scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
	  b
	  (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
  b
  (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

* The first procedure yields:
```Scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```
This procedure implements a *linear recursive process*; the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(a)$ and the space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(a)$.

* The second procedure yields:
```Scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 8)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```
This procedure implements a *linear iterative process*; the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(a)$ and the space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
