```Scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)

(define (new-sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
    guess
    (new-sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                   x)))

(new-sqrt-iter 1.0 25)
```

If Alyssa's LISP interpreter uses normal-order evaluation, there should be no difference between the original `if` and her new procedure `new-if`. 
However, things change when we use applicative-order evaluation.

As it was shown in [[1-5]], applicative-order evaluation evaluates the arguments of the procedure call before substituting them into the body of the procedure.

Therefore, the call to `new-sqrt-iter` becomes replaced with a call to `new-if` which calls `new-sqrt-iter` as its second argument. This in turn calls the same procedure again: we cannot return unless all the arguments have been evaluated.

It is clear that this recursion does not reach an end, which makes the `new-if` procedure unusable for procedures that reference themselves.
